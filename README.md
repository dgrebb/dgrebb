# Howdy! I'm Dan.

I love computers. They've been a major part of my life for over 25 years.

I've been building websites since 1999, and am always experimenting with new technology.

I currently work at <a href="https://github.com/comcast" target="_blank">Comcast</a>, and fight for the users.

Be excellent to each other.
